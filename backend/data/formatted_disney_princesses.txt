Name: Cinderella Cinderellais
Description: the titular protagonist of hereponymous filmand two sequels and is the second Disney Princess. She is based on the European fairy tale of the same name, of which several variations exist. It is based on the French version. Ilene Woods provides the voice/singing voice for Cinderella (Original Disney version), Jennifer Hale provides the voice of Cinderella in the sequels, Tami Tappan provides Cinderella's singing voice inCinderella III.

Name: Aurora Aurorais
Description: the titular protagonist of the filmSleeping Beauty, based on the classic fairy tale involving a beautiful princess, a sleeping enchantment, and a handsome prince. Aurora is sixteen years old. Mary Costa provides the voice/singing voice for Aurora, giving her a British accent. The original story is much darker than the Disney version. It is Italian and involves her falling under a spell after getting a splinter, and the rest is too grim to put on here. Disney based theirs off the French version, which was based on the Italian version. Aurora has the distinction of being both the Princess with the least amount of screen time and singing more of her lines than speaking them. Aurora has the purest pedigree of any Disney Princess, being the first and only child of a king (King Stefan) and also presumably marriesPrince Phillip, the firstborn son, and heir of a king (King Hubert).|

She is sixteen years old in the first film, 15 in the prequel, and is presumably in her thirties in the sequel. Ariel's title of Princess comes from her father,King Triton, a title she shares with her six older sisters. She acquires the title of Queen Consort through her marriage to Eric, though it is unclear whether he is a Prince Regnant (most likely), the son of a King, or both.

Name: Belle Belleis
Description: the fifth Disney princess and the female protagonist of the filmBeauty and the Beastand its two sequels. Paige O'Hara provides the voice/singing voice of Belle in all three films. Belle is the first Disney Princess to have a confirmed country in the movie (France) while most princesses have hints of their home countries.

Upon the death or abdication of her father in favor of Aladdin (as was stated to be the Sultan's wish), Aladdin would become the Sultan of Agrabah and Jasmine would acquire the title of Sultana. She is the first princess to not be the titular character in her film and is the first non-white and the first Middle Eastern/southwest Asian princess.

Name: Pocahontas Pocahontasis

Pocahontas is the second Princess (after Jasmine) to have her singing voice and speaking voice provided by two different voice actresses. Irene Bedard and Judy Kuhn provide the voice and singing voice of Pocahontas in both movies, respectively. Pocahontas was born as the only child ofChief Powhatan, thus giving her the title of Chieftain's Daughter. Though not royalty, she is accorded the respect of one (i.e. a princess) in the sequel and is officially regarded as a Disney Princess. Her eventual marriage toJohn Rolfe(a commoner) does not change her status or his.

Name: Mulan Fa
Description: Mulanis the titular protagonist in the Disney filmMulanand its sequelMulan II. She is the first Disney Princess to be based on a legend and the second not to be based on a fairy tale (Pocahontas).

Mulan is (to date) the only Disney Princess who does not hold the title of Princess in one form or another. However, she does earn the non-noble title of Imperial Consul. Her eventual marriage toGeneral Li Shang(also non-noble) does not grant her any titles either. Mulan and Shang are the only non-royal Disney couple in the Disney Princess franchise.

Name: Merida Meridais

Kelly MacDonald and Julie Fowlis provide the voice and singing voice for Merida. Merida is a Princess by blood; firstborn ofKing Fergusof DunBroch.
Her lack of romantic interest (and lack of any sequels) makes it unlikely that she will rise to rule the kingdom as a Regnant Queen, considering the views of gender equality in the era. Merida is noteworthy for being the first Princess to be a wholly original character, as she is not based on a pre-existing character from a fairytale or folktale.

Name: Moana Moanais
Description: the titular protagonist of the Disney film of the same name. The daughter of Motunui's village chief, Moana was chosen by the Ocean to restore the Heart of Te Fiti and save her island from life-killing darkness.
The fourth Princess to come from the minds of John Musker and Ron Clements, Moana is one of the few Disney Princesses not to be based on a preexisting character. Rather, her story (save for Maui and his exploits) is almost wholly original. Furthermore, unlike her most recent predecessors, Moana was not inducted with a coronation event. Instead, she was slowly integrated into officialDisney Princessmerchandise such as books, social media posts, and toy lines following the release of her film, before being added to the franchise's official website as an official member in 2019. She is the ninth princess overall to be officially inducted into the franchise without a coronation. However, she is the first princess to be lately inducted when the franchise was already in function. She is also the second princess, after Merida, who doesn't have a love interest and the third CGI Princess after Rapunzel and Merida.

Each of the following women have been associated with the Disney Princess Franchise or seen with the other Princesses.
